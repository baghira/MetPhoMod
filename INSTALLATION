MetPhoMod installation notes

To install MetPhoMod on a UNIX system carry out the following steps:

1.) Check if the netCDF-library is already installed on your system. If
    not, get it from

    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html

    and install it according to the instructions you find there. You will
    need netCDF v3.0 or newer for MetPhoMod.

2.) If you want to use the parallel version of MetPhoMod, you need the
    PVM3 library, too. You can get a complete distribution at
    
    http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html.

    Install it according to the instructions you find there.

3.) Move the MetPhoMod-archive file "mc.v2.0.tar.gz" to the your
    MetPhoMod base installation directory.

4.) Unpack the file with this UNIX command:

    gunzip -c mc.v2.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

5.) Edit "Makefile" and adapt it to your system. Instructions can be
    found in the file.

6.) Build the program with either "make opt" or "make optp", depending
    on the version you want to use.

The compiled software consists of a single file called
"meteochem". You can copy it into a directory which is mentioned in
the PATH environment variable.  Notes for Windows 95/98/NT users

Copying the executable from this WEB site directly, is probably the
easiest way to install MetPhoMod on a PC. This executable has been
buildt, using the CGWIN package (see http://www.cygnus.com/).
